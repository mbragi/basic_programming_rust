- variables are defined in snake case and can be used to stored data types, function expressions or code blocks.
- constants are directly inserted defined as UPPRER_SNAKE_CASE_CASED and are inserted at runtime without consuming memory and can be defined either as global or local scope.
- bitwise operators work on binary level of integers.
- always use () to group statements based on precedence with most being left - right assocuation i.e executes first from left to right.
- scalar types are data types that represent a single value rather than collection examples "integers, floating, boolean and characters".
- as keyword performs type casting with a risk of losing data without warning when casting from a type with higher bit to a smaller type.
